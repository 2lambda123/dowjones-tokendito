# Contributing

Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change you make. Each
logical change should be its own separate pull request. For example:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`,
    `git checkout -b fix/my-fix`)
3.  Add and commit your changes to your fork
    (`git commit -m 'Added some feature'`)
4.  Push to your fork (`git push origin feature/my-new-feature`)
5.  Create new Pull Request from your fork onto the tokendito repo
6.  Assign the PR to a team member.

-   Capitalize the subject line
-   Do not end the subject line with a period
-   Use the imperative mood in the subject line
-   Wrap the body at 72 characters
